## Introduction
Despite the sweeping advances the internet has made in knowledge accessibility, many individuals still lack access to crucial information about illnesses, leaving them vulnerable and uninformed. Bridging this global disparity in healthcare information must be a top priority to ensure everyone has the tools to safeguard their well-being.

Mental health is often relegated to the shadows of public discourse, despite its profound impact on individuals and society as a whole. Recognizing and addressing mental health with the same urgency as physical health is crucial for a healthier and more empathetic society.
## How It Works
### Symptom Diagnosis
Dr. AI is a revolutionary application aimed towards ensuring equal access to medical knowledge.

### Image Processing
We also use the [BLIP](https://huggingface.co/Salesforce/blip-image-captioning-base) image captioning model on HuggingFace to create diagnoses based on photos as well.

### Virtual Therapist
Dr. AI also features a virtual therapist, also powered by ![img](https://cdn.sanity.io/images/rjtqmwfu/production/ae020d94b599cc453cc09ebc80be06d35d953c23-102x18.svg), which can be used **daily** by users to bolster their mental health and self-esteem.
