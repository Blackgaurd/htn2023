## Introduction
Despite the sweeping advances the internet has made in knowledge accessibility, many individuals still lack access to crucial information about illnesses, leaving them vulnerable and uninformed. Bridging this global disparity in healthcare information must be a top priority to ensure everyone has the tools to safeguard their well-being.

## How It Works

Dr. AI is a revolutionary application aimed towards ensuring equal access to medical knowledge.
With ![img](https://cdn.sanity.io/images/rjtqmwfu/production/ae020d94b599cc453cc09ebc80be06d35d953c23-102x18.svg)'s generative LLMs, along with our own clever [prompt engineering](https://www.promptingguide.ai/), Dr. AI is able to accurately diagnose illnesses, given a list of user-provided symptoms.

We also use the [BLIP](https://huggingface.co/Salesforce/blip-image-captioning-base) image captioning model on HuggingFace to create diagnoses based on photos as well.

## Our Design Philosophy

Due to our commitment to accessibility, we have designed Dr. AI to be as simple and intuitive as possible. The user interface is clean and minimalistic, and the application is designed to be usable by anyone, regardless of their technical expertise. In the below GIFs, we demonstrate how easy it is to use Dr. AI.
